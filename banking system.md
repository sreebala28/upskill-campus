# Bank Management System in Java

• Bank is the place where customers feel a sense of safety for their property.
In the bank, customers deposit and withdraw their money. Nowadays, managing a bank
is a tedious job upto a certain limit. So a bank management system that reduces
the work is essential. Also, today’s world is a genuine computer world and is
getting faster and faster day-by-day. 

• Thus, considering the above necessities, the system for bank management has
become necessary which would be useful in managing the bank more
efficiently.

## Problem Statement:
• The Bank Management system consists of the bank administrator and
the customer. The administrator will need to create a new account for
the customer by logging into their existing account. The system executes operations like creating a new account, checking
the balance of the account, withdrawing, depositing, money transfers
between two accounts, and viewing transaction history.
